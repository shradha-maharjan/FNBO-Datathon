# Datathon 2025 – First Mav  
**FNBO Secured Credit Card Portfolio Analysis**

## Project Overview
This project was developed as part of Datathon 2025 and focuses on analyzing First National Bank of Omaha (FNBO)’s secured credit card portfolio. The objective was to understand customer behavior, credit utilization patterns, and risk profiles, and to generate data-driven insights that support credit improvement, customer retention, and portfolio growth.

Using a dataset of approximately 10,000 secured credit card accounts, we performed exploratory analysis, customer segmentation, and predictive modeling to identify opportunities for improving credit outcomes and reducing churn among new-to-credit customers.

## Business Problem
FNBO aims to:
- Understand who secured credit card customers are
- Analyze customer spending patterns and credit utilization
- Identify high-risk customers and risky behaviors
- Predict which customers are likely to improve their FICO score
- Predict which customers are likely to churn or become inactive
- Develop targeted strategies for risk management, engagement, and growth

---

## Data Overview
- Number of accounts analyzed: ~10,000
- 83.5% of accounts showed FICO score improvement compared to account opening
- 68.4% of customers fall into the Poor to Fair credit score categories
- Credit utilization calculated as:

Key features include customer demographics, transaction behavior, spending categories, geographic location, income, credit utilization, and FICO scores at account opening and current state.

## Key Analyses

### Customer Demographics and Spending
- Market share analysis by income group and generation
- Total spend and transaction count by generation
- Consistent top spending categories across generations:
- Groceries
- Gas
- Dining
- Minor variations observed for Gen Z spending behavior

### Credit Health and Utilization
- Analysis of credit utilization patterns
- Comparison of FICO score at account opening vs. current FICO score
- Identified a FICO score dip in March 2025, aligning with student loan delinquencies reappearing on credit reports

### Customer Segmentation
Customers were grouped into four behavioral segments:
- Moderate (≈41%): Balanced spending and credit health
- High Risk – Low Spend (≈24%): Low engagement and potential drop-off risk
- High Risk – High Spend (≈19%): Active usage but over-leveraged
- Low Risk – High Value (≈16%): Strong candidates for graduation to unsecured products

Key insight: High engagement does not always indicate financial stability.

## Predictive Modeling

### Objectives
- Predict likelihood of FICO score improvement
- Predict likelihood of customer inactivity or churn

### Key Findings
- Highest predicted credit improvement observed in states such as TN, AK, VA, and NH
- Credit improvement is strongly influenced by moderate utilization and stable income
- Identified customer profiles with elevated churn risk for targeted intervention

---

## Strategic Recommendations

### Credit Line and Risk Management
- Implement real-time utilization and risk monitoring
- Use predictive alerts for early intervention
- Adjust credit lines before balances reach high-risk thresholds

### Product and Rewards Strategy
- Strengthen everyday spend rewards (Groceries, Gas, Dining)
- Introduce simple and transparent cashback incentives
- Design tiered pathways from secured to unsecured credit products

### Growth and Reactivation
- Launch regional education and engagement campaigns in high-churn states
- Expand reactivation efforts in high-potential markets
- Introduce graduation campaigns for maturing or dormant accounts

---

## Research and Industry Insights
Findings align with industry research indicating:
- Rewards simplicity and fee transparency are critical for first-time credit users
- Approval likelihood and clear upgrade paths drive long-term loyalty
- Fraud protection and virtual card options are increasingly important to customers

---

## Conclusion
This project provides FNBO with a clear, data-driven roadmap to reduce portfolio risk, improve customer credit outcomes, increase engagement, and drive sustainable growth within the secured credit card portfolio.
